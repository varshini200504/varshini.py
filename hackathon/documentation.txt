#Customer Data Analysis Script Documentation

##Overview
An overview of a Python script intended to carry out several analysis on client data is given in this documentation. 
The script manipulates and visualizes data using the pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. 
Customer loyalty, waste reduction, price sensitivity, digital presence, and detailed customer loyalty are all included in the assessments. The outcomes of these analyses are likewise saved by the script to distinct CSV files.


##Requirements
To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
we use the following code
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install pandas

##Data
The script uses a sample dataset with 20 entries. The dataset includes the following columns:
- customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer
- purchase_history: Number of purchases made by each customer
- waste_amount: Amount of waste generated by each customer
- price_change: Change in price for each customer
- sales_volume: Sales volume for each customer
- visit_frequency: Frequency of visits by each customer
- customer_feedback_score: Feedback score given by each customer
- social_media_engagement: Social media engagement for each customer
- online_reviews: Online review scores for each customer


##Script Overview
The script performs the following analyses and saves the results to separate CSV files:

1.Customer Loyalty Analysis
2.Waste Reduction Analysis
3.Price Sensitivity Analysis
4.Detailed Customer Loyalty Analysis
5.Digital Presence Analysis

### 1.Analysis of Customer Loyalty
Each customer's loyalty score is determined by this analysis using their past purchases. 
The customer_loyalty_analysis.csv file contains the results. The loyalty scores are displayed as a bar plot.

### 2.Analysis of Waste Reduction
The amount of waste for every consumer is examined in this investigation. 
The waste_reduction_analysis.csv file contains the results. 
The amount of trash is visualized via a line plot.

### 3.Analysis of Price Sensitivity
The association between price adjustments and sales volume is examined in this investigation.
The price_sensitivity_analysis.csv file contains the results. 
The association is visualized using a scatter plot.

### 4.Comprehensive Analysis of Customer Loyalty
By taking customer feedback scores and visit frequency into account, this research offers a more thorough understanding of client loyalty. The detailed_customer_loyalty_analysis.csv file contains the results. 
The total loyalty scores are displayed as a bar plot.

### 5.Analysis of Digital Presence
This study looks at how internet reviews and social media activity affect sales volume. 
The digital_presence_analysis.csv file contains the results. 
The impact is visualized using a scatter plot.


## Implementation
To conduct the analyses and produce the CSV files, the script invokes each analytic function one after the other.

## Wrap-up
This screenplay offers a thorough examination of consumer data, including topics such as digital presence, price sensitivity, waste reduction, customer loyalty, and detailed loyalty. To shed light on the data, visualizations are created and the results are saved to distinct CSV files.
